            Rather than respond to trends, Kawakubo rooted her designs in
            concepts, straddling art and fashion. Her designs often looked
            voluminous on the wearer’s body. Because they did not fit the
            industry’s perception of what women wanted, her garments were
            sometimes described as <strong>antifashion</strong>.

            featured oversized, loosely knit sweaters with holes that looked as
            though they had been slashed open. The dark, disheveled style was
            dubbed by the media the “postatomic look” or “Hiroshima chic”, or
            the “bag lady” look.

            collection and was criticized for blatantly disfiguring the female
